# The great bot apocalypse

Hi all,

It appears that YouTube has started blocking any Discord music bot of moderate size. They are aggressively limiting how many requests we can send to their servers. The wider Discord bot community is currently trying to develop workarounds against this problem.

In the meanwhile, you will be able to use [FredBoat Patron](https://www.patreon.com/fredboat). FredBoat Patron only able to play from YouTube because it is a very small bot. While we would love to provide music from YouTube for free, that is currently not possible.

Other sources of music such as SoundCloud and Bandcamp are unaffected.

Thank you for your unstanding!

-Fred
