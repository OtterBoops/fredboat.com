FredBoat will not be able to play tracks blocked in the US (usually due to copyright infringements on YouTube).

## Adding music to the playlist
Adding music to the playlist is pretty simple. To start playing a track, use the ;;play command. Here are two examples:
```
;;play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
;;play rick roll
```
You can either explicitly state the URL, or you can get FredBoat to search YouTube and give you some choices. Here's an example response:

```
Please select a track with the ';;play 1-5' command:
1: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (03:33)
2: YOUTUBERS REACT TO RICKROLL (Ep. #5) (09:20)
3: I Rick Roll My Entire Chemistry Class! (05:55)
4: The New Rick Roll! (04:26)
5: Melania Trump's RNC RICKROLL (00:19)
```

You can then choose your track with `;;play <number>`, or just do`;;1` to select the first result, or `;;3` to select the third result, or even `;;4 1 3` to select more than one result.
