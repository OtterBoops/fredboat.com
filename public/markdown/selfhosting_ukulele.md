# Selfhosting FredBoat

* * *

**Disclaimer**: Over the past few months, the FredBoat team has been working on delivering the most scaleable and reliable music experience, making big changes to the application stack. With the help of game.tv, we have been smooth-sailing, though this introduced a few drawbacks specifically for selfhosters:
- Most of the code has transitioned to being closed source, which means the docker images needed are not necessarily up to date.
- FredBoat's code has grown into a heavy-duty stack aimed to service millions of servers with thousands of players runing at once, which is the exact opposite of what a selfhoster is looking for.
- The resouces needed for the stack to run have grown out of proportion from what a selfhosted instance (or two) running in a few servers.

With all of that in mind, we have decided to stop providing help with selfhosting FredBoat in its current state, but that does not mean we'll leave you hanging.

# Introducing Ukulele

We would hate to completely isolate our wondeful selfhosting community (and also revisit our roots), so we decided to make a new self-contained, simple and lightweight bot that you can use.

Currently Ukulele is in early stages of development, though slowly but surely we are aiming to bring you a similar experience to FredBoat, but without the extra complexity.

If you would like to learn more about how to set up Ukulele, please visit/star the [github repository](https://github.com/Frederikam/ukulele), where you can find instructions on hosting it or even contribute to it!
