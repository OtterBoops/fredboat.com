# Help test beta version of FredBoat
We are in need of testers for the Cutting Edge version of FredBoat. We'll soon be releasing a new version of, but we
want to ensure it is stable before releasing it. To participate, simply add 
[the Cutting Edge bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=341924447139135488&scope=bot) to your server.

Things to bear in mind:
* The quality of this bot is slightly better than the regular one.
* Use the prefix `<<` instead of `;;`
* We don't guarantee any uptime. Do not report that the bot has gone offline.
* Most of the changes are under the hood, so not much functionality has changed. 
* If you find any bugs, please report them to the `#cutting_edge_bot` in our Discord server.
  * Alternatively, send an email to `cuttingedge@frederikam.com`.
